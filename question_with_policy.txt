Create a 5 step plan to transition to biodegradable packaging materials. In particular, focus on using PET Plastics with Biodegradable PLA. You have to focus on how you would do this in a company that has 1000 employees and 10000 products.

Policy on Transitioning to Biodegradable Packaging Materials: Replacing PET Plastics with Biodegradable PLA

**Purpose:**
*This policy aims to transition all packaging materials from petroleum-based polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic to biodegradable polylactic acid (PLA) by the end of the next fiscal year. PLA is a biodegradable polymer derived from renewable resources such as corn starch, sugarcane, or cassava, making it a more environmentally friendly alternative to PET, which contributes significantly to plastic pollution.

**Scope:**
*This policy applies to all divisions within the company responsible for packaging design, materials sourcing, production, and waste management. The transition will be implemented across all product lines, and the packaging must meet the functional requirements previously fulfilled by PET. The change should focus on reducing the environmental footprint while maintaining cost-effectiveness and material performance.

**Guidelines:**

*Material Testing: R&D teams must conduct comprehensive tests on PLA to ensure it meets the same durability, shelf life, and functionality as PET packaging. PLA must undergo tests for strength, permeability, and resistance to environmental factors (e.g., heat, moisture).
*Supplier Transition: The Procurement department must identify certified suppliers of biodegradable PLA who comply with international standards such as ISO 14855 (biodegradability in composting conditions) or ASTM D6400 (compostability in industrial facilities).
*End-of-Life Management: Collaborate with the Waste Management team to ensure appropriate systems are in place for the composting and recycling of PLA packaging, and work with local authorities to promote the proper disposal of biodegradable materials.
